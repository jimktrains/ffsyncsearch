My FireFox Sync
---------------

I want to build something that can sync my bookmarks and history
in order to turn them into a searchable archive. Too often I find 
I can't quite google something or there is a lot of noise in FF's history
sidebar.

config.ini

Sample:

    [user]
    email=address@example.com
    password=super_secret
